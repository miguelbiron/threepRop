Description: This is a port of the MATLAB code provided by the authors of the
    3prop paper. It also provides a function to efficiently simulate Stochastic
    Block Models for two classes. Additionally, it contains a utiliy function
    to calculate the area under the ROC curve (AUROC) for assesing performance.
